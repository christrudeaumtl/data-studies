## Readme
There are two parts to this repository: 1) the codebook (Codebook.md) and 2) the script (run_analysis.R).

The Codebook describes the project and the work that the script does. Please consult the codebook before running the script.

The script can be run from any working directory and will check that the data files have been downloaded and unzipped before proceeding. The output is a single text file called data.txt. Full description of both the script and the output are available in the codebook.
